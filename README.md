# [insert game name]

A game set in a cold war scenario, like real history but not of real history.

Gameplay will be similar to [Advance Wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Wars).

See [this blog post](http://gelatindesign.co.uk/games/a-road-to-creating-indie-games)

The target completion date is Dec 2015, with release in Q1 2016.
