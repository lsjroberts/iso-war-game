# Cold

A game set in a cold war scenario, like real history but not of real history.

Gameplay will be similar to [Advance Wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Wars).


## Sprints

Development will be split into sprints with set objectives. The primary target
is to develop the game to a playable state at the end of each sprint. This is
to ensure motivation is maintained and the progress can be tested and feedback
can be received on the current state.
